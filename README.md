Allows the usage of regular expressions as triggers for bot responses

Regular expressions and their responses are stored in a seperate file which can be opened in the systems default editor by pressing the edit button

A regex must be encapsulated by forward slashes. The responses must be encapsulated by double quotation marks. Both items must be seperated by a space
One line per regex/response pair
i.e.
```
/.*[wW].*[oO].*[wW].*/ "WOW"
```
